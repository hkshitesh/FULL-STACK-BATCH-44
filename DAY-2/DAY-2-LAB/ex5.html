<h1>Multiple Styles Will Cascade into One</h1>
<p>Here, the background color of the page is set with inline CSS, and also with an internal CSS, and also with an external CSS.</p>
<p>Try experimenting by removing styles to see how the cascading stylesheets work (try removing the inline CSS first, then the internal, then the external).</p>
